# Planet Genesis — working notes

A LittleBigPlanet-style creative sandbox: paint materials into a world, they
become real physics bodies, then play in it. One self-contained HTML file,
Matter.js for physics, everything else hand-written.

**Read this before changing anything.** Most of what follows was learned the
hard way, and several of the invariants look arbitrary until you break one.

## Layout, and why it is flat

Every file sits at the repo root. That is deliberate, not neglect: the test
suites resolve `preview.html` next to themselves, and `mkprev.py` reads
`planet-genesis.html` from the working directory. Splitting into `src/` and
`tests/` is a fine idea, but it is a change to a working system and should be
done on purpose, with the suites re-run, not as a drive-by tidy.

| file | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| `planet-genesis.html` | **The game.** ~408KB, the source of truth, what gets published. |
| `geom.js` | The polygon geometry core. Also inlined verbatim inside the HTML — see the hazard below. |
| `pc.min.js`, `earcut.min.js`, `matter.min.js` | Vendored libraries, kept for the test harness and for re-inlining. |
| `mkprev.py` | Builds `preview.html`: swaps the Matter CDN for the local copy, strips web fonts, appends the `window.__pg` test hook. |
| `regress.js` `tsel.js` `tlayer.js` `tmat.js` `tlight.js` `tctx.js` | Playwright suites, 97 checks between them. |
| `tenv.js` | Finds the machine's Chrome and resolves `preview.html`. Every suite goes through it. |
| `checkgeom.js` | Verifies `geom.js` still matches the copy inlined in the HTML. |
| `level.json` | Carson's real level. The perf runs measure against this, not a synthetic one. |
| `teardown.html` | An architecture teardown of the project, written earlier. Predates the polygon rewrite — its "leave it alone" section describes the old dab model. |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Carson's direction for the whole project. The goal all the work aims at. |

### Running the tests

Once, to install the driver:

```
npm install               # playwright-core only — no browser download
```

Then:

```
python mkprev.py           # regenerate preview.html after ANY edit to the HTML
npm test                   # all 97 checks + checkgeom, in order
npm run perf               # migration and frame time on level.json
```

Or one suite at a time:

```
node regress.js            # 22 checks — geometry, save/load, play mode
node tsel.js               # 17 — selection, marquee, group transforms
node tlayer.js             # 9  — layer accuracy and ranked picking
node tmat.js               # 16 — materials, colours, glass, light
node tlight.js             # 20 — lighting, shadows, glow
node tctx.js               # 13 — the right-click popit menu's lifetime
node checkgeom.js          # geom.js vs the inlined copy
```

The suites run against `file://preview.html` in whatever Chrome or Chromium
the machine already has. `tenv.js` finds it — the search order covers the
Playwright Chromium on Linux, Chrome and Edge on Windows, and Chrome on
macOS — so no suite hardcodes a path any more. Set `PG_CHROME` to override.

`playwright-core` rather than `playwright` on purpose: it drives a browser
you already have instead of downloading a private 130MB copy.

**Tests that paint into a dynamic object must aim at where it *is*, not
where it was painted.** Build mode runs physics, so anything not static has
already fallen by the next drag. `tmat.js` reads the body position first;
copy that pattern rather than a fixed offset, or the test passes only on a
machine slow enough to hide the fall.

**`preview.html` is generated and gitignored.** All test hooks live in
`mkprev.py`, never appended ad hoc — and `window.__pg` must never reach
`planet-genesis.html`. Publishing a build with the hook in it would expose the
whole editor's internals to anyone who opens the page.

## The geometry core

Every painted shape is a real polygon, the way LBP stores material: a flat
list of corners split into loops, with painting, erasing and cutting as
boolean union and difference. Not a pile of overlapping circles — that is what
this replaced, and it is why carves are clean and zoomed-in framerates are flat.

Built on `polygon-clipping` (exact arithmetic, robust) and `earcut`
(triangulation with holes), **both inlined** into the HTML. The editor's core
operations must not depend on a CDN being reachable.

### Types

```
Ring       [[x,y], ...]          implicitly closed, no repeated last point
Poly       [outer, hole, ...]
MultiPoly  [Poly, ...]           each Poly is one CONNECTED piece
```

### The winding convention — outer positive, holes negative

Enforced by `pgClean`, relied on everywhere. It buys two things at once:
canvas `fill()` (nonzero) handles holes for free, and it is exactly the vertex
order Matter.js wants (verified against `Bodies.rectangle`). Reverse a ring
and you get an invisible shape with inside-out collision.

### The CSG material rule — LBP's own

Painting material A **unions into A's region and subtracts from every other
region.** This is not an approximation of LBP, it is what LBP does: its
`RMaterial` carries an explicit `disableCSG` flag, which only exists because
CSG is the default. Painting over another material in the same plane carves it
and auto-glues.

Consequence worth remembering: same base material, different tint, is a
*different* region — `"wood"` and `"wood:16"` carve each other. That is
intended and matches LBP.

### Other geometry facts

- **Swept brush.** Dragging a convex brush covers the Minkowski sum with the
  drag, which is the convex hull of the brush at both endpoints. Circles use a
  directly-built capsule instead. `sweepRing` walks the far arc from `a0`
  *decreasing* by π so it passes through the direction of travel — go the
  other way and you get a bowtie. `circleRing` forces an even segment count so
  the capsule's two half-arcs meet.
- **Physics decomposition.** earcut triangulation (holes handled natively) then
  Hertel–Mehlhorn merge into convex parts. `MAX_PART_VERTS = 24`.
- **`pgUnionMany` is a balanced chunked reduction**, not one big union call.
  One call goes quadratic: 1,200 circles took 6.2s, the reduction does it in
  262ms, because each sweep stays small and interior corners are discarded at
  every level.
- **Tolerances:** `GEOM_TOL = 0.45` (live paint), `GEOM_TOL_MIG = 1.05` (v2 dab
  migration), `PHYS_TOL = 1.4`, `SHADOW_TOL = 5`.
- **Budgets:** `MAX_OBJ_CORNERS = 9000`, `MAX_LEVEL_CORNERS = 260000`,
  `MAX_PHYS_PARTS = 1400`.

---

## Matter.js facts that are easy to get wrong

- `Body.create({position, vertices})` **recentres the vertices on their area
  centroid.** So passing `ringCentroid(ring)` as the position leaves them
  exactly where you put them. Pass anything else and the shape moves.
- Compound `Body.create({parts})` sets position to the area centroid too.
- Per-part `isSensor` works for collision resolution — you do not need a
  separate body to make one region of an object pass through.
- Each rebuild **bakes the body's accumulated rotation into the stored
  polygons and resets `body.angle` to 0.** Geometry is always stored unrotated.
- `rebuildFromPieces(o, {a:0, x:0, y:0})` when the geometry you are handing it
  is already in world space — otherwise you double-apply the frame. That bug
  made flips jump.

---

## Rendering

- One `Path2D` per material region. Passes run **per region** — fill, then a
  clipped two-band bevel, then ink — so a later region covers an earlier one's
  outline. Drawing all the ink after all the fills puts a hole's outline on top
  of whatever filled it.
- **Depth is alpha plus a side-face offset. There is no geometric scale.** An
  earlier version scaled back/front layers by 0.88/1.1, which made the drawn
  shape stop matching the polygon: shapes appeared to shrink or grow on
  release and hit-testing missed them. Do not reintroduce it.
- `objectAt` ranks hits — build layer first, then layer, then draw order —
  rather than returning the first match in creation order. Without this a
  background object steals clicks from something in front of it.
- Objects rasterise to a bitmap cache and blit each frame. When an object is
  too large to cache it bakes *softer*, it does not fall back to redrawing
  paths every frame — that cost 8ms on one of Carson's back-layer objects.

## Lighting

- Half-resolution buffer (`LR = 0.5`), per-light scratch canvas sized to the
  light, not to the screen. Both of those were performance fixes worth ~20ms.
- `destination-out` burns the hole, `lighter` casts the colour. The gradient is
  drawn in the light's **own colour** so alpha burns and colour fills in one
  pass; recolouring the whole canvas with `source-in` afterwards cost 13ms.
- Lights are culled by reach, and the scratch clear is tightened to the used
  region — clearing the whole scratch per light was most of a frame.
- Shadows are quads projected from back-facing edges. The interior normal of a
  positively wound ring is `(-dy, dx)`. Each quad's winding is normalised, or
  overlapping quads cancel under nonzero fill.
- Glow range is 10%–1200% (`GLOW_MIN = 0.1`, `GLOW_MAX = 12`), radius is
  `L.r + 100 * glow` — **linear**, not squared.

## The popit menu

`ctxObj` tracks which object the open menu belongs to and `ctxCam` snapshots
the camera at open time. `pruneObjCtxMenu()` runs every frame and closes the
menu when its object is gone or the camera has moved more than 6px. It is a
catch-all on purpose: no future way of deleting an object or moving the camera
has to remember the menu exists.

---

## Known hazards

- 🔴 **`geom.js` is duplicated.** The standalone file and the copy inlined in
  the HTML are kept in sync by hand. `node checkgeom.js` catches drift; a real
  build step would retire the problem. Until then, edit one and copy it over.
- 🔴 **`doSave()` uses `.add()`**, so every save creates a *duplicate* document
  rather than updating the existing one. Two 165KB duplicates already exist.
- 🔴 **A thrown error kills the render loop permanently.** One bad frame and the
  game is a still image until reload. It needs a try/catch that survives.
- 🟠 **Autosave writes ~140KB synchronously every 15 seconds.**
- 🟠 Levels have no owner, id, or thumbnail.
- 🟠 Characters and My Objects are localStorage-only.
- 🟠 408KB in one file is at the edge of comfortable.

## What's next

**[`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) is the full picture** — Carson's direction for the
whole project, captured 2026-09-10 and sorted by what each part depends on.
Read it before planning anything larger than a bug fix.

The short version. Near-term, cheap and self-contained: the bolt rework,
region-delete (Delete should remove the selected material region, not the whole
object), the fill tool, a 4x larger world, and the water/ice polish. Then the
LBP gadget family — buttons, levers, player and water sensors, emitters, mover,
world changer, creature eye — none of which exists yet, and which is the
biggest jump in what a level can actually do.

Also still wanted from the earlier list: custom drawn materials (the save
schema already reserves `u:<id>` keys — needs a drawing surface, property
sliders, naming, and embedding into levels), layer peek, and sprint on shift.

The floppy swingable rope is **superseded**: the player mechanic is an
LBP-style grab, designed for keyboard and mouse rather than a held shoulder
button. Ropes as level objects are unaffected.

Beyond that the project grows a hub world, several more creation surfaces
(creatures, music, backgrounds, particles, a rollercoaster, a 2.5D mode), and
an online platform with levels, friends, multiplayer, currency and a store.
That last part needs a backend that does not exist; `ROADMAP.md` says what has
to be decided before it is built.

## How Carson works

He directs the design; the code is mine. He wants a senior developer, not an
order-taker: **push back before implementing something that creates technical
debt.** Slow and solid beats fast and fragile. Preserve working systems, and
don't rewrite things for cleanliness. The target is LBP's actual behaviour —
when in doubt, research what LBP really did rather than approximating it.

"We have all the time in the world."
